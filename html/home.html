        <h2>What language is used in developing this game ?</h2>
        <p>
          GDScript evolved as a custom scripting language to be used with the Godot computer (and mobile device) Game engine.<br>
GDScript is easy to learn with a syntax similar to Python where the code is indented rather than using lots of brackets and semi-colons.
         allows for rapid code development and leverages the rich library of available functions within the Engine for fast enough speed of execution for the Game Logic in most cases.
